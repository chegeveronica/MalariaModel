## SUMMARY

TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google for the sole purpose of building and training machine learning models.

One of the datasets under the Tensorflow Image libraries is a malaria dataset which contains approximately 27,500 cell images of parasitized and uninfected cells from thin blood smear slide images of segmented cells.

Using this dataset, I have created a model which is able to classify whether a blood smear is uninfected or parasitized.
